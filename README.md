Employee attrition is when an employee leaves the company through any method,
including voluntary resignations, layoffs, failure to return from a leave of absence,
or even illness or death. Whenever anyone ceases working for the company for any
reason and is not replaced for a long time (if ever), that would be employee attrition.
There are two main types of employee attrition:
Voluntary attrition: When an employee chooses to leave the company, that is
voluntary attrition. This can include any reason an employee leaves on their own
accord, whether it’s truly voluntary or not. True voluntary terminations, such as
resignations for a new job or to move across the country, are the ones you’re
probably most familiar with. But an employee who leaves due to health reasons or
only quits because the work situation is toxic can also fall under voluntary attrition.
The company retains the decision not to replace the employee–although there are
some times the company would like to replace someone but cannot.
Involuntary attrition: When the company decides to part ways with an employee,
this is involuntary attrition. This can be through a position elimination, for example,
due to reorganization or layoffs, for cause (such as stealing or fighting), poor
performance, or termination when someone abandons their job. (You can argue
the last one is a voluntary termination, but the company makes the final call to
terminate.) The company then doesn’t backfill the position or eliminates it.
